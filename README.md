1. Till the following date we have progressed in our project idea building by referring to the following papers uploaded on our GitHub and published our own paper which is included too.
2. We conducted a survey based out of the Basavanagudi Merchant's Association group in March 2021 regarding availability of metal detectors and CCTV cameras present in stores across the area.
Out of around 57 of the stores that we were able to enquire with, 41 had CCTV facilities in and around the stores and only 3 had the facility of metal detectors or any such relevant scanning facility in their stores.
